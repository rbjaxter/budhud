</div>

## Installation and Customization
A full installation guide & video can be found [here](https://github.com/rbjaxter/budhud/wiki/Installation).

The [HUD wiki](https://github.com/rbjaxter/budhud/wiki) contains a wealth of information on installing the HUD as well as customizing it. However, feel free to reach out in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/PTWkt3h) if you have any other questions.

### Installation (TL;DR)
1. Find your TF2 install location
    * The fastest way is to open Steam -> Select `Games` -> `View Games Library` -> right click `Team Fortress 2` -> `Properties...` -> Under `Installed Files`, click `Browse...`
2. Navigate to `../tf/custom`
    * If you don't have a `custom` folder, create it
3. Download the latest release
    * You just need the first zipped file (typically called `budhud.zip`)
4. Extract the zipped file into your `../tf/custom` folder
    * You can use Windows' built in extraction (right click > `Extract All...`) or a program like 7-Zip
    * Ensure you don't have two folders within each other (see below)

> To see if your folder is placed correctly, we'll use the `info.vdf` file as an example.
>
> The path to the `info.vdf` file should be:
>
> `../tf/custom/budhud/info.vdf`
>
> NOT
>
> `../tf/custom/budhud/budhud (or ANY other folder)/info.vdf`
>
> **This is the most common mistake people make when installing a hud.**
